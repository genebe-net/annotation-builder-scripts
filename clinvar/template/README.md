## ClinVar

[ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is a public database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) that collects and curates information about genetic variants and their clinical significance. It provides insights into how genetic variations are associated with diseases, supporting clinical genetics, research, and precision medicine.

ClinVar is open for contributionsâ€”anyone can submit genetic variant data for review. The database is **updated weekly** to ensure the information remains current and relevant.

### Build data
This database was build using the https://github.com/genebe-net/annotation-builder-scripts/tree/main/clinvar script.
