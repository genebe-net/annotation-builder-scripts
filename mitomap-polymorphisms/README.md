## MITOMAP Polymorphisms - Cataloging Human mtDNA Variation

MITOMAP Polymorphisms, part of the MITOMAP human mitochondrial genome database, compiles an extensive, hand-curated list of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants—19,811 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as of January 15, 2025—drawn from 61,883 full-length GenBank sequences (hg38-aligned) and updated every 4-6 months. Detailed in Lott et al. (2013) in Current Protocols in Bioinformatics, this resource tracks population-level polymorphisms alongside disease-associated mutations, accessible at https://www.mitomap.org/MITOMAP/resources (polymorphisms.cgi feed).

Script downloads the tsv from https://mitomap.org/cgi-bin/polymorphisms.cgi and converts it to GeneBe Hub format.
