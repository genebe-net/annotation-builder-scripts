```
Variant classification is based on the pathogenic probability predicted by CardioBoost. According to the ACMG guidelines, we use Pr>=0.9 as the high classification certainty threshold to classify variants. A variant with lower than 90% classification probability is considered as indeterminate with low classification confidence level. In short, a variant is classified given its predicted pathogenicity:

pathogenicity>=0.9: Disease-causing
pathogenicity<=0.1: Benign
0.1<pathogenicity>0.9: Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)
